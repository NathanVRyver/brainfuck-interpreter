#  BRAINFUCK INTERPRETER

## ABOUT

THIS PROJECT IS A BRAINFUCK INTERPRETER WRITTEN IN HASKELL.
IT EXECUTES BRAINFUCK CODE (`.BF` FILES) AND PROVIDES DETAILED DIAGNOSTIC LOGGING ALONGSIDE THE PROGRAM'S ACTUAL OUTPUT.

## FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

- **STANDARD BRAINFUCK COMMANDS:**
  - `>`: MOVES THE DATA POINTER TO THE RIGHT.
  - `<`: MOVES THE DATA POINTER TO THE LEFT.
  - `+`: INCREMENTS THE BYTE AT THE DATA POINTER.
  - `-`: DECREMENTS THE BYTE AT THE DATA POINTER.
  - `.`: PRINTS THE BYTE AT THE DATA POINTER AS AN ASCII CHARACTER.
  - `[`: JUMPS PAST THE MATCHING `]` IF THE BYTE AT THE POINTER IS ZERO.
  - `]`: JUMPS BACK TO THE MATCHING `[` IF THE BYTE AT THE POINTER IS NON-ZERO.
- **8-BIT WRAPPING CELLS:** DATA CELLS HOLD VALUES FROM 0 TO 255. INCREMENTING BEYOND 255 WRAPS TO 0, AND DECREMENTING BELOW 0 WRAPS TO 255.
- **LOOP HANDLING:** CORRECTLY PROCESSES `[` AND `]` COMMANDS, INCLUDING SUPPORT FOR NESTED LOOPS.
- **DIAGNOSTIC LOGGING:** PRINTS A STEP-BY-STEP TRACE OF EACH INSTRUCTION EXECUTED. THIS LOG SHOWS:
  - THE CURRENT INSTRUCTION BEING PROCESSED.
  - A SNIPPET OF THE REMAINING SOURCE CODE.
  - THE CURRENT STATE OF THE TAPE (THE VALUE IN THE CURRENT CELL AND A FEW OF ITS NEIGHBORS).
- **CLEAR OUTPUT SEPARATION:** THE INTERPRETER'S DIAGNOSTIC LOGS ARE KEPT SEPARATE FROM THE ACTUAL OUTPUT GENERATED BY THE BRAINFUCK PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM'S OUTPUT IS DISPLAYED UNDER A DEDICATED "==== INTERPRETED RESULT ====" HEADER.
- **INPUT FILE FILTERING:** THE INTERPRETER AUTOMATICALLY FILTERS THE INPUT `.BF` FILE TO ONLY PROCESS VALID BRAINFUCK COMMAND CHARACTERS (`><+-.,[]`). ANY OTHER CHARACTERS IN THE FILE ARE IGNORED.

## HOW TO RUN

1.  **BUILD THE PROJECT (IF YOU HAVEN'T ALREADY):**
    OPEN YOUR TERMINAL IN THE PROJECT'S ROOT DIRECTORY AND RUN:

    ```BASH
    CABAL BUILD
    ```

2.  **EXECUTE A BRAINFUCK FILE:**
    USE THE `CABAL RUN` COMMAND, FOLLOWED BY THE EXECUTABLE NAME (`HORSING-AROUND`), THEN `--`, AND FINALLY THE PATH TO YOUR BRAINFUCK (`.BF`) FILE.

    THE GENERAL FORMAT IS:

    ```BASH
    CABAL RUN HORSING-AROUND -- PATH/TO/YOUR/FILE.BF
    ```

    FOR EXAMPLE, TO RUN THE `HELLO_WORLD.BF` EXAMPLE LOCATED IN THE `EXAMPLES/` DIRECTORY:

    ```BASH
    CABAL RUN HORSING-AROUND -- EXAMPLES/HELLO_WORLD.BF
    ```

## EXAMPLE FILES

THE `EXAMPLES/` DIRECTORY CONTAINS SEVERAL BRAINFUCK PROGRAMS TO TEST AND DEMONSTRATE THE INTERPRETER'S CAPABILITIES:

- `EXAMPLES/HELLO_WORLD.BF`:
  - A CLASSIC PROGRAM THAT PRINTS "HELLO WORLD!" FOLLOWED BY A NEWLINE CHARACTER.
- `EXAMPLES/LOOP_A_X3.BF`:
  - THIS PROGRAM DEMONSTRATES A SIMPLE LOOP. IT PRINTS THE CHARACTER 'A' THREE TIMES.
- `EXAMPLES/NESTED_LOOP_ZERO_CELL.BF`:
  - ILLUSTRATES THE HANDLING OF NESTED LOOPS AND A COMMON BRAINFUCK IDIOM `[-]` WHICH IS USED TO SET THE CURRENT CELL'S VALUE TO ZERO. THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM MANIPULATES DATA ON THE TAPE BUT DOES NOT PRODUCE ANY VISIBLE CHARACTER OUTPUT (I.E., IT DOES NOT USE THE `.` COMMAND).
- `EXAMPLES/SIMPLE.BF`:
  - IF A FILE WITH THE CONTENT `>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++[++++]++++++++++.` IS USED, IT WILL PRINT A SINGLE NEWLINE CHARACTER. THIS IS DUE TO THE 8-BIT WRAPPING CELL BEHAVIOR WHERE THE LOOP `[++++]` EVENTUALLY CAUSES THE CELL (INITIALLY 28) TO WRAP AROUND TO 0, TERMINATING THE LOOP, AFTER WHICH THE CELL IS SET TO 10 (NEWLINE) AND PRINTED.

## PROJECT STRUCTURE (KEY FILES)

- `APP/MAIN.HS`: THE MAIN ENTRY POINT OF THE APPLICATION. IT HANDLES COMMAND-LINE ARGUMENTS, READS THE BRAINFUCK FILE, INITIALIZES THE TAPE, CALLS THE INTERPRETER, AND FORMATS THE FINAL OUTPUT.
- `APP/INTERPRETER.HS`: CONTAINS THE CORE LOGIC FOR INTERPRETING THE BRAINFUCK CODE. IT PROCESSES EACH COMMAND, MANAGES LOOP EXECUTION, AND ACCUMULATES PROGRAM OUTPUT.
- `APP/TAPE.HS`: DEFINES THE DATA STRUCTURE FOR THE BRAINFUCK TAPE AND PROVIDES FUNCTIONS TO MANIPULATE IT (MOVING THE POINTER, INCREMENTING/DECREMENTING CELL VALUES WITH 8-BIT WRAPPING, AND ACCESSING CELL VALUES).
- `EXAMPLES/`: A DIRECTORY CONTAINING `.BF` FILES FOR TESTING.
- `HORSING-AROUND.CABAL`: THE CABAL BUILD CONFIGURATION FILE FOR THE PROJECT.
